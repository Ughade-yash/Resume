                    Well, I’ve been <strong> working on mobile app development for four years now</strong>, while still studying at college. Had my own projects, coded mostly in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, but my account on the play store got suspended, for reasons I still fail to understand. But I learned a lot, both at school and while working on the apps. Now I am looking to get a job with an <strong>innovative game studio</strong>, and am glad to be interviewing with you here. Apart from coding, I enjoy reading a good book, or a nice evening out with friends. That would do for a short introduction, please tell me if you’d like me to elaborate on anything from my education, or experience with apps.
